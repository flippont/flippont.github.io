        Hello I'm Flippont :) If you want to get in touch with me, you can find me on <a href="https://boxd.it/9N4xN">Letterboxd</a>, <a href="https://x.com/flippont">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.albumoftheyear.org/user/flippont/">Album Of The Year</a>.
        I love films, music and the likes and I've picked up piano recently. Let's see how that goes. <br>
        To talk a bit about myself, I was born in Japan, and I grew up in Ireland. Before you ask, no, I didn't adapt to the yupbro aesthetic.<br>
        I have a few projects that have collected dust over the years, and I will try to showcase them here. I also have a blog where I write about things that interest me, and I will try to keep it updated as much as possible. <br>
