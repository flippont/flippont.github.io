        </br>
        <p>Welcome to the gallery of failed experiments, where we showcase the most soulful, but unsuccessful attempts at creativity. From bizarre art pieces to questionable design choices, this collection is a testament to the fact that not every idea is a good one. Enjoy the ride through this gallery of failed experiments with way too many barrier poles for a website. </p>
        <p>Literally what the heck am I doing with my time.</p>

        <h2>1. "Techtonic Activities" (Oil on canvas) - 2025</h2>
        </br>
        <p>What originally started as a poor attempt at an inside joke, <b>"Techtonic Activities"</b> is a compillation work to some of the most prominent pop culture references of the 20th and 21st century.</p>
        <p>The image is a striking one with pop culture references ranging from Shinji from Evangelion wearing "dank meme sunglasses", to the interractive centerpiece with the illuminati. The more niche side of reference is made with the inclusion of <a href="">Geordie Greep</a> (from the band Black Midi) and <a href="">Corey Feldman</a>, both highly talented musicians to their own regard.</p>
        <p>The joke is almost funny to the people who don't get the inside jokes, but unfortunately the inclusion of italian brainrot and big chungus completely soil the joke.</p>

        <h2>2. "Griddy in Motion" (Oil on canvas) - 2025</h2>
        </br>
        <p>"Griddy in Motion" is a more in-depth approach to tackle the problems of "Techtonic Activities"</p>
        <p>The picture has an underlying theme, and while it still uses niche pop culture references as a point of interest, it's a lot more approachable and less intimidating than Techtonic Activities.</p>
        <p>The poor tasted attempt at humour can clearly be seen improved, but there are clearly still clearly rough points (most notably the lack of colours and use of open space).</p>

        <h2 id="griddy">4. "Portrait of a Lady On Fire" (Oil on canvas) - 2025</h2>
        </br>
        <p>As an obvious homage to the 2019 masterpiece <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/portrait-of-a-lady-on-fire/">Portrait of a Lady on Fire</a> by CÃ©line Sciamma, this dares to ask the question, what if the mona lisa was a core member of the hit children's television series "Thomas the Tank Engine" </p>
        <p>This is a lot more underwhealming than the other works. It isn't the sensation overload that is Techtonic Activities, and it serves no other purpose than it being a less than acceptable meme.</p>
        <p>It is what it is though. No doubt about that.</p>

        <h2 id="griddy">6. "Rodin's Brutalist Thinker" (Stone, wax, steel / leatherwork) - 2025</h2>
        </br>
        <p>To take things in a completely different direction, Rodin's Brutalist Thinker poses the macabre question "How pretentious could something possibly be". As a textbook solution to that, this combines two of the most artsy, annoying pretentious works of art in the history of humanity and combine them.</p>
        <p>Rodin's Thinker, is a test sculpture for Rodin's masterpiece "the gates of hell" (inspired by Dante's inferno) and has the thinker resting as the centerpiece of the gates. The sculpture depicts a nude, muscular man seated on a rock, pondering in deep contemplation, and was initially intended to represent Dante himself, a metaphor how the key to all evil is conciousness.</p>
        <p>In comparison, the Brutalist is a 2024 oscar winning film that depicts a Brutalist architect Laslo Toth, the strive for modernism after the war and the struggles of immigration. This chair is shown in a key scene, where Toth builds a library commisioned by a rich patron. </p>
        <p>One depicts an existentialist sense of pretentious, and the other shows that the thinker is rich enough to buy a chair that's probably worth my house. </p>
        <p>I could have added a set of earphones blaring the Smiths to the thinker, but I feared that would be too much for anyone to handle. This is probably the only thing worth making in real life, and if there are any updates I'll be sure to post them here.</p>
