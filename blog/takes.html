            <h1>Forming my opinions (might add more later)</h1>
            </br>
            <p>This all gets a bit ranty so bare with me. I’m also not going to
                talk about things that are just common sense like “the IDF are genocidal fascists that are protecting a
                piece of land that’s barely theirs, and Hamas are pretty bad too” and “climate change is real”. I know
                no one asked for my opinion, but also, I very much needed a place to vent.

            <h2>Preface: my opinion’s are just right you can’t do anything about it.</h2>
            </br>
            <p>Kant had the idea of “transcendental idealism” which basically means no matter how objective you look at
                something you always look at something with rose tinted glasses no matter how hard you try – it’s human
                nature. (you can look it up yourself if you want a more in-depth analysis, I’m not Wikipedia over here)
            </p>
            <p>However, there are certain aspects and ideas that most people seem to share, especially among those who
                really care about a specific topic whether that’s music or trains it doesn’t matter people who take
                things seriously seem to naturally like the same kind of things.</p>
            <p>Strange, isn’t it? Diversity in opinion seems to shrink the more people get invested in things. I bet
                there’s like a fancy philosophy word for all of this but in my eyes, this just happens because taste
                gets refined around the thing you’re perfecting. If you watch 1000 films seriously, your taste gets
                refined towards good films simply because your idea towards what “a good film is” is based on your own
                personal knowledge of films and not your original subjective opinion. I think we unintentionally develop
                a checklist of what’s good and bad every time we are exposed to an idea that we are unfamiliar with,
                based on our nature and nurture. People who go through the same education system would have similar
                ideas because of that. Not to imply we’re being spoon-fed propaganda, but media literacy at its core is
                just another way to say the more you are informed the more logic is behind your ideas – hence nuance is
                added. </p>
            <p>It's more that concept of gaining nuance that is shared humanly, rather than a greater objective taste
                encompassing our inner conscience. Because of that, we tend to shame people who don’t conform to this
                nuanced liberalism in both situations of “being informed with the wrong information” and “choosing to
                not be informed at all from the idea of exercising free will”.</p>
            <p>Long story short, my taste is superior, (which is the well informed nuanced taste) and if you don’t agree
                with me, that’s just your problem. The myth of enjoying anything – isn’t there someone that you forgot
                to ask? That’s right it’s me – flippont.</p>
            <p>Now that I have that preface of my opinion’s superiority out the way, I can get to my takes.</p>

            <h2>General politics</h2>
            </br>
            <p>The rise of populism has led us to realising that the system is kinda broken. I think that’s a really
                good thing because when people take consequences for stuff they didn’t do, they realise that they
                personally need to act or else that dire situation will continue happening. We’ve got poverty, class
                divide, war everywhere because we voted people that was very good at faking charisma. Take Trump for
                example. He, along with Elon Musk have somehow managed to convince the world that they’re playing 4D
                chess to make the world a better place by moving to mars and building a wall when in actuality both of
                those individuals are having a hard time not to eat the pieces. Being a clueless geriatric somehow
                appeals to people when your political system is a complete pissing contest two party state and the
                checks that were in place (I’m using America as an example because it’s funny how bad it’s gotten) mean
                nothing – so much so that the president can openly admitting to bribery and face no repercussions. Same
                with the UK – Kier Starmer, while labour is still marginally better than the Tories is still taxing the
                poor and relieving the rich and is cutting welfare for people with disabilities now (it’s the same here
                in Ireland as well with the total scam that is the children’s hospital and allowing mega corporations to
                just straight up evade tax). People are so transparently evil now it’s depressing to see. I’m not saying
                there’s a right or wrong to any situation, but let’s try to be more kind – and I don’t say that to be
                naïve. I say that so people can actually keep their hands to themselves – which I believe will solve 99%
                of the political problems we have today. Just keep your isolationism away from me, and accept the fact
                that a diverse society is a healthy one. Goes to show how American arrogance is kinda to the extreme. To
                quote Frank Zappa – “The thing that sets America apart from the rest of the world, is that we’re so
                f**king stupid”</p>

            <h2>Let’s talk transgender rights</h2>
            </br>
            <p>Yeah trans women are women I’m not an idiot honestly all you bigots really need to leave other people’s
                lives alone. I have nothing against trans women being in women’s sport either let a queen ball am I
                right or am I right. Why do people even get heated up about trans women in sports. Like look the
                percentage of trans women and men in sports is so low that it shouldn’t even spark the debate. </p>
            <p>If I had to name a bigger problem with the sporting industry I more have a problem with straight women
                enjoying male dominated sports like whipping your dogs out and popping open a kombucha with the boys on
                a Friday afternoon reading feminist literature. Like I think it’s complete cultural appropriation to
                look at this artform that men have been refining for hundreds of years just for straight white women to
                come along and say “yeah that’s so cool can we join your Sylvia Plath reading group?” Ok buddy who
                called you to the cool corner. The white boys take learning Mandarin and studying to be a shaolin monk
                pretty seriously, I don’t want you all to disrespect that. </p>
            <p>That’s enough banter – let’s get serious. On the argument of “trans people are perverted predators who
                want to sneak into the bathroom of the opposite sex and sexually harass people” yeah predators would
                have done that either way and it’s generally illegal and rude to begin with to take photos of other
                people in public? This isn’t a gender/sex specific thing grow up mate. “It’s unchristian” like I’m a
                baptised Christian but like it’s a fundamental part and creed of being a Christian to “love thy
                neighbour” and accepting others for who they are you can’t just cherry pick bible verses from
                Deuteronomy and pretend like you’ve made a huge point about how being trans is somehow “unnatural”. God
                made everyone perfect, and they made trans women perfect as women. Is that such a hard concept to grasp?
                It pains me to say but I've met so many Christians that are like “they’re obviously going through a
                tough time, let’s pray for them” instead of actually trying to be empathetic, and it’s honestly
                disgusting.</p>

        <div class="article" id="abortion">
            <h2>Roe v Wade is American propaganda</h2>
            </br>
            <p>Everyone addresses abortion as “pro choice” now. It pisses me off so much. In context it gives off the
                idea that if you’re pro life you’re “anti choice” which isn’t true, and if you’re pro choice it gives
                off the idea that you’re “anti life” which isn’t true either (well maybe you do hate life as a concept I
                shouldn’t put words in people’s mouths). As a guy I do believe there is a factor of “guys shouldn’t talk
                about what women should do with their bodies” but in a democracy we can live to choose decisions for
                other people’s lives (that’s why I think anyone over the age of 80 shouldn’t be able to vote – it’s not
                their future) so the level of arrogance in guys for the topic is actually devastating. I personally
                believe that women should be able to do whatever they want; it’s their body. You have to realise that
                the foetus is a collection
                of cells: if you talk about the potential of life then every cell we kill daily, whether that’s
                scratching your face or stepping on a lego is “potential life” so it's completely preposterous to even
                consider that as a valid argument. Also people
                need to consider the fact that no one “enjoys” an abortion. There are situations where people have an
                abortion to relieve the pain of the child, or to avoid death from childbirth it really isn’t as simple
                as “are you pro choice or pro life” as it is with most things. So yeah, believe in what you want but
                please stop calling it pro choice or pro life and call it something completely unrelated like “do you
                support Mouldy Korean barbecue or asbestos in your car”. </p>

            <p>Anyways I hope you enjoyed me ranting on about all this. I’ll probably add more to this in the future,
                but I hope you can see I have no idea what I’m talking about despite that long and winded intro.</p>
