            <p style="color: white">It was an oddly rainy day today, and I wasn’t motivated to do anything.
            </br>
                I just sort of sat there on my bed reflecting on all the things I did right, and all the things I didn’t. 
                It wasn’t quite existential, but I was contemplating ethical worth, what I symbolise in terms of being a section of a functional society riddled with a fear of missing out that I didn’t quite grasp fully: most of which spanned from an overly self-conscious image that I have kept as an ideal, but some of it was genuine. I thought I might use this space to rant a bit about these things instead of keeping them to myself, especially on the theme of worthlessness in society.

            <p style="color: white">So, What does it mean to “be worthless”? Let’s break it down. I think it’s an inherently human thing to desire acceptance from others. This is not only because each and every one of us are self centred to an extreme but I believe that we are fundamentally designed to find emotional comfort in acceptance as an evolutionary trait to thrive and create competition as a pack animal. Worthlessness in this context is the contradiction. The conditions in a person that results in the absence of this animalistic desire in oneself. The source doesn’t matter, whether that’s from an anti-social behaviour or jeopardising some grand scheme, all that’s there in the end is a designed mental instability from rejection, both from society and any individual. </p>

                At the end of the day, 50% of the time this doesn’t dictate anything. Most people are so filled with their own dogmatism that they don’t even attempt to feel any sympathy towards others, and being emotionally controlled by acceptance and rejection in this kind of scenario just proves your insecurity. A sort of deranged imposter syndrome, if you will. In the end, this “ethical worth” doesn’t exist. If people judge you for who you are rather than what you did, that’s proof that the person who’s judging you is too insecure to have the need to compare themselves with others. On the contrary, 50% of the time judgement comes from your own actions. The novel “No Longer Human” by Osamu Dazai dictates just this, on a personal journey of isolation and escapism ultimately becoming the fatal flaw of the central character: while the novel is one of the greatest works of literature I’ve set my hands on, I’m still under the impression that the human capacity of forgiveness is not as closed as people think it is. Everyone makes mistakes, that’s a given, and we have a leeway of forgiveness when it comes to actions that you have no control over. Laws were created for a certain section of society to express their ideologies over others disguised with the moral blanket of “controlling those who act by instinct rather than considering what’s best as a society”. Ultimately, judgement is just a one dimensional conclusion, a form of escapism if you will by following an arbitrary concept of morality designed to profit some over others. No system is perfect as they say, but the idea that some moral standards are higher than others is an idiosyncratic one.

                We live in a world that’s an almost surrealist cluster of mixed ideas and theologies that could only be achieved with the advancement of technology that the internet has brought. This blog is a prime example of this, where I could create something completely publicly available that’s hidden in the terabytes of contrarian remarks and politically biased propaganda. What’s important is to avoid as much bias as possible and look at both sides of the equation and to be devoid from judgement. While I understand this is an extremely naïve take (and exactly the kind of idealism that results in judgement - kind of ironic eh?), and there’s nothing inherently wrong with judgement. I just think it's important to keep these principles in mind: that most importantly, to an extent we’re all worthless.</br>
